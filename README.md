Orchestration of Routing and VNF Placement in 5G Networks


## Abstract

The fifth generation of wireless networks has been proposed as a platform to provide considerably higher network capacity, enable massive device connectivity with reduced
latency and cost, and achieve considerable energy savings. In this regard, network design, management and upgrades require the use of innovative technologies and architectures.
Enterprise and service provider networks are increasingly making use of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to reap the benefits of reduced Capital expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating expenses (OPEX).

In this research, the problem of placing virtual network functions on existing resources as well as data routing through these functions to execute a particular service chain is
investigated. A network consisting of switches, servers and links with determined specifications is considered and an optimization problem is designed to minimize the total cost of links and servers utilization, considering different constraints. These constraints include network constraints, topology constraints and the constraint on maximum congestion of links. Here, in order to estimate costs, both the service provider view and the cloud provider requirements are taken into account. In the following, two heuristic algorithms to solve the optimization problem are presented and the performance of one of them is evaluated by simulation.
